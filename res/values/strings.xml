    <string name="tut_line_20">Good.</string>
    <string name="tut_line_21">And now, try to\nteleport behind the box.</string>
    <string name="tut_line_22">You know all the basis, I guess...</string>

    <string name="stg1_line_5">Well... Right.\nShall we begin?</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_6">Heh. You\'re quite good...</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_7">Tell me about The Fourth.</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_8">Fist?</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_9">He looks slow,\nbut don\'t let his apperance fool you.</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_10">He can surprise an opponent\nhis quickness.</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_11">I\'ve challenged him once,\nbut, as you can see, \nI\'m still only Number Five...</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_12">You were.</string>
    <string name="stg1_line_13">Heh, right.\nNow you are The Fifth.</string>

    <string name="stg2_line_3">Oho! I can see, you quite straight forward</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_4">You really want to be Number One, don\'t you?</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_5">No.</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_6">I just want revange.</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_7">Who\'s The Third?</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_8">Khe, khe!</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_9">I... I guess, I won\'t make it...</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_10">Who\'s The Third?</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_11">The Witch... Khe, khe...</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_12">She can controll projectiles.\nNo one has found out yet how she does it.</string>
    <string name="stg2_line_13">Khe, khe! You must have good reason, to, khe,\nfight other Pilots with such a presistency.</string>

    <string name="stg4_line_3">The Third...</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_4">She was someone special to me...</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_5">You\'ll pay for what you\'ve done!</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_6">Was it worth?</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_7">What was it worth?</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_8">To aim for it at all cost?\nAre you really that much\nwant to be Number One?</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_9">Who\'s The First?</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_10">Kiddo, The First is first for 15 years!</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_11">For 15 years no one have beaten him.</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_12">Don\'t you even try to challange him!</string>
    <string name="stg4_line_13">Who is he? Where I can find him?</string>
